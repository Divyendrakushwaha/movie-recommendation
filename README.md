Overview

This project is a content-based movie recommendation system that helps users find movies similar to their interests. The system is built using Flask as the backend and employs TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization for computing movie similarities.

How It Works

The system creates vector representations of movies based on their content (such as descriptions, genres, and other textual features).

TF-IDF Vectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text is used to transform movie descriptions into numerical vectors.

When a user selects a movie, the system computes the nearest matches using cosine similarity.

The most similar movies are then recommended to the user.

Technologies Used

Flask: Backend framework for serving recommendations

Scikit-learn: Used for TF-IDF vectorization and similarity computation

Python: Core programming language

HTML/CSS: Frontend for displaying recommendations

Features

Content-based filtering: Uses movie descriptions to find similar movies

Dynamic recommendations: Users can input a movie and get real-time suggestions

Lightweight and fast: Flask-based API ensures quick responses

Future Enhancements

Improve recommendations using word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT)

Include user preferences to enhance personalization

Deploy as a cloud-based service

This project provides an efficient way to discover movies based on textual similarity, making it a valuable tool for movie enthusiasts!
